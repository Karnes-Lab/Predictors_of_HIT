# Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Functional Assay Demographic Analysis

### Author: Jason Giles
### Last Updated: August 1, 2023

## Set-up
This is the master README for the demographics analysis performed on the Laboratory and demographic predictors of functional assay positive status
in suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: A multicenter
retrospective cohort study (*Giles et al., 2023*). 

Original phenotypic data for Tours & Greifswald
cohorts is available in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes
(dbGaP: phs accession number phs002863.v1.p1). Code used in this
study is available on Github (https://github.com/karneslab) and data
from the McMaster cohort are available from the corresponding author
upon reasonable request.

### Code

The available code is broken down into each cohort for the initial analyses. There also is a combined dataset `R` code that was used in the latter stages of the analyses. These are labeled to give clear indication of the cohort analyzed and the steps in each stage of the analysis. 

### Figures

Figures used in the original manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2023.07.011) are posted to the Github as well.
